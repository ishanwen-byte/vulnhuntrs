# Security Analysis: routes.py - HTTP request handlers

## File Information

- **File Path**: `benchmarks/XBEN-001-24/app/website/app/routes.py`
- **Detection Pattern**: HTTP request handlers

![High Confidence](https://img.shields.io/badge/Confidence-High-red) **Confidence Score: 90**

## 脆弱性タイプ

- `IDOR`

## PAR Policy Analysis

### Principals (Data Sources)

- **order_id parameter**: Untrusted
  - Context: HTTP path parameter
  - Risk Factors: tampered_parameter
- **session_user**: SemiTrusted
  - Context: session data
  - Risk Factors: session_hijacking

### Actions (Security Controls)

- **authorization**: Missing
  - Function: authorization
  - Weaknesses: missing authorization
  - Bypass Vectors: 

### Resources (Target Objects)

- **Order.order_id**: High
  - Operation: read
  - Protection: 

### Policy Violations

#### PAR-Auth-01: Missing authorization check allows access to unauthorized resources (Pattern: HTTP request handlers)

- **Path**: order_receipt -> Order.query.get(order_id) -> render_template
- **Severity**: high
- **Confidence**: 0.90

## Matched Source Code

```code
add_header
```

## Detailed Analysis

The order_receipt endpoint lacks user authorization checks, creating an IDOR vulnerability that allows viewing other users' order receipts.

## PoC (Proof of Concept)

```text
# Retrieve another user's order receipt using arbitrary session cookie
curl -b "session=<UserA's valid cookie>" http://example.com/order/999/receipt
```

## Remediation Guidance

### order_receipt endpoint

- **Required**: Implement ownership check for order before rendering receipt
- **Guidance**: Validate that order.user_id == session['user_id'] and return 403 if not
- **Priority**: high

## Analysis Notes

Code inspection completed. The principal is the order_id obtained from HTTP requests (untrusted), while session user_id is evaluated as semi-trusted.
The order_receipt function retrieves orders via Order.query.get(order_id) without authorization checks, allowing access to any order_id. The resource operation (reading Order table receipts) was assessed as high confidentiality.
Authorization as an action is not implemented (missing). This policy violation was identified as an IDOR vulnerability.
